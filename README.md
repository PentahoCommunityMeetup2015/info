# Sunday: Venue info, agenda, etc.

## Location: central London

## Agenda: the London sightseeing tour you wish all sightseeing tours would be like.

A guided tour of London not to be missed. Only 30 spots available, pre-registration required when you sign-in to the conference on Saturday.

Will last 2 hours approximately, covering the City of London and surrounding areas.

# Hotels

Below are a few hotel suggestions.

Please note London is a very large city and commuting may be time consuming. We suggest you choose a hotel either close to the conference venue (Acton, White City, Sheperd's Bush) or closer to the social even on Saturday night (Covent Garden, Soho, Charing Cross).

London Underground is expected to start a 24 hour service during the fall on week-ends. The announced date was September 12, but the recent Tube strikes have pushed this back and there is no official date for commencement of the 24 service yet.

## Central London
These hotels are close to the social events on Saturday night, but expect around 30 minutes to get to the conference venue on Saturday:
- Travelodge Covent Garden: https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/318/London-Central-Covent-Garden-hotel
- The Z Hotel Soho: http://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/the-z-hotels-soho.en-gb.html
- The Bloomsbury Hotel: http://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/the-bloomsbury.en-gb.html
- Cheshire Hotel: http://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/cheshirehotel.en-gb.html
- Holiday Inn London Mayfair: http://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/holiday-inn-london-mayfair.en-gb.html

## Acton/White City
Closer to the conference venue. They are located in zone 2 of the London transporation zone, about 15-20 minutes from Central London
- Holiday Inn Express Park Royal (next to North Acton central line tube station): http://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/exhiparkroyal.en-gb.html
- Westfield Apartments (next to White City tube station): http://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/26-white-city-close.en-gb.html
